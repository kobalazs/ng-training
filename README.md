# NgTraining

Training material for beginner Angular course. This material has been (and probably will be)
re-implemented from time to time to follow the changes of Angular. Check repository branches
named as `ng<version>` for the latest implementation!

Some additional features were developed too for extra syllabus / training material. See branches
named as `ng<version>-<feature-name>`!
